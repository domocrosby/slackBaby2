This should be pretty simple
- Install node.js & Heroku
Mongodb
- install using "brew install mongodb"
- make directory using "sudo mkdir -p /data/db"
- give permissions using sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db

- Just Fork and clone this repository (if owner then copy and change remote)\
- Change repository name to the name of the app 
- To setup a new dev app run "npm run setup-dev-app", this will have saved the default auth address to the clipboard
- To setup as a new dev environment run "npm run setup-dev"
- To authenticate the app run "npm run dev-auth" 
- To develop the app run "npm run dev"
- To create a staging environment on heroku use "npm run setup-staging-app", this will have saved the default auth address to the clipboard but you will need to enter the name of the app plus staging
- To configure the staging environment run "npm run setup-staging"
- to authorize user on staging use "npm run staging-auth"
Ongoing
- to save use "npm run git"
- to push to staging use "npm run stage-git", you will need to run the above first


- run using mongodb, 
- open another window and use mongo to connect
